# FTB-Quests WebView

**Disclaimer**:

Neither I nor this project are affiliated with the FTB Team or any of their mods. This project is a private project of mine that I will mainly use for practicing JS/TS development on an actual product. 

## What is this

This is intended to be a web based Quest Viewer for Modpacks using FTB Quests. The idea was born out of somebody on the Create: Astral Discord server wanting a way to view them on their phone. I looked at the files in the `config/ftbquests` directory in the modpack and decided that `.snbt` was parsed easily enough and I could try making a web viewer as an exercise.

## Usage

Don't. It doesn't work yet.

## Contributing

This is a Lerna monorepo using typescript and pnpm. Setup should be as easy as cloning the repo and running `pnpm install` in the root folder.
